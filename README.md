# Global-Forcast-of-Covid-19-and-Covid-19-in-India
Data Analysis of covid-19 worldwide and forecasting of covid-19 in India. 

The aim of the project is to provide data analysis of covid-19 (a pandemic started in December 2019). Through plotting of data, various cases have been studied like most affected countries due to this pandemic. Study of data from various countries is combined to show the growth of cases and recovery graph. In this project, the predictions on various cases have been done and finally, the accuracy of the algorithm has been determined. The project mainly focusses on data analysis of country India. And the project also focusses on the analysis of vaccines administered by India and various visualizations techniques.

## DATA SOURES:

The following sources of data are used:
1. COVID19 Global Forecasting from Kaggle
2. https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/csv
3. COVID_19_INDIA from Kaggle
4. covid_vaccine_statewise from Kaggle

## TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES:
We have used the following data Analytics technique / methodology for analyzing the Data:
•	Summary of Statistics for each variable
•	Structure of the dataset
•	Using Graphs and density Plots to visually represent them 
Tools used: RStudio, Kaggle and Excel.
Techniques: Time Series Plot, Density plot, Bar Chart, Line Chart, Correlation, Heat map. We have used R Programming environment and Microsoft Excel for our analysis and Tableau for data.

## Analytics Approach:
The Analytical Approach will involve the following activities:
•	Data extraction from Primary Data source as well as secondary data sources
•	Data quality check
•	Data cleaning and data preparation
•	Study each of the variables by exploring the data
•	Division of data into train and test
•	Model Development
•	Final Model
•	Model Validation
